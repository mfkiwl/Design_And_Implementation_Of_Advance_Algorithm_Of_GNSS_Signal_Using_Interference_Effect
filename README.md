# Design And Implementation Of Advance Algorithm Of GNSS Signal Using Interference Effect

- **Description:**
  1. This project focuses on the design and implementation of algorithms to improve the accuracy and reliability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals by mitigating the effects of interference.
  2. The project leverages a combination of hardware (such as Raspberry Pi, GPS, IMU, and NAVIC receivers) and software tools (Python, MATLAB) to collect, analyze, and visualize GNSS data. By addressing issues such as noise, multipath effects, and signal variability, the project aims to enhance the precision of location-based services.
  3. The analysis is performed on both static and dynamic data collected from various locations, and the interference is studied to understand its impact on signal accuracy.

- **Key Features:**
  1. Data Collection: The project utilizes Raspberry Pi to interface with GPS, IMU, and NAVIC receivers for collecting static and dynamic GNSS data. Data is recorded in both urban and rural settings to analyze the impact of different environmental conditions on signal quality.
  2. Interference Analysis: The project investigates various types of interference, including ionospheric, electromagnetic, and atmospheric interference, and their effects on GNSS signals. The impact of signal jamming and other disruptions is also studied.
  3. Algorithm Development: Advanced algorithms are developed to process the raw GNSS data, with a focus on filtering techniques to reduce noise and improve signal accuracy. Python is used for data extraction and processing, while MATLAB is employed for data visualization and analysis.
  4. Static and Dynamic Mode Analysis: The project compares GNSS data collected in static (stationary) and dynamic (moving) modes to evaluate the performance of the receivers under different conditions. The positional error and signal strength are analyzed to identify potential improvements.
  5. Visualization and Reporting: The results of the analysis are visualized using graphs and charts generated in MATLAB and Excel, providing clear insights into the GNSS signal behavior under various interference conditions.
  6. Practical Applications: The findings of the project have practical implications for improving the accuracy of navigation systems, particularly in areas with high levels of interference or challenging environmental conditions.
